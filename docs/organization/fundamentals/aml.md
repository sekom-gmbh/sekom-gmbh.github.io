# __AntiMoneyLaunderingPolicy__


---

Our Company will take measures to prevent the Company and its employees being exposed to money laundering, to identify areas in which money laundering may occur and to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, especially the process for reporting actual or suspected money laundering cases to the General Manager. It is the responsibility of every employee to be vigilant and act promptly in all suspected cases.

  

**Introduction**


  

1.  The Proceeds of current Crime, Terrorism and the Money Laundering Regulations place obligations on the company and its employees with respect to suspected money laundering, the key points being:
    

  

*   The reporting and detection of suspected money laundering.
    
*   Employees must be vigilant for the signs of money laundering.
    
*   Any employee who suspects money laundering activity must report this promptly to the company General Manager.
    
*   No payment to the company will be accepted in cash if it exceeds €10’000.
    
*   Where the company is carrying out certain regulated activities during day to day business then the customer due diligence procedure must be followed.
    
*   The Money Laundering Regulations are complex and detailed and should there be any doubt about the policy requirements, please request further information from line management.
    

  
**The Policy**
    

  

1.  The policy applies to all employees and sets out procedures for the reporting of suspected money laundering activities with the aim to reduce potential criminal activity. The policy defines procedures that will assist the company to comply with its legal obligations.
    

  

2.  The Policy should be read along side the companies Whistleblowing Policy, Anti-Fraud and Corruption Policy and the Treasury Management Practice – money laundering guidelines.
    

  

3.  Failure of an employee to comply with the procedures defined within this policy may lead to disciplinary action in line with the companies Disciplinary Policy Procedures.
    

  

**What is Money Laundering?**
    

  

1.  Money laundering is a term used which relates to offences involving the proceeds of crime or terrorism funds. The following acts are defined as acts of money laundering:
    

  

*   Concealing, disguising, converting, transferring criminal property.
    
*   To enter into or become concerned in an arrangement which you know or suspect will assist the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property or on behalf of another person.
    
*   Acquiring, using or possessing criminal property.
    

  

These are primary money laundering acts, two secondary offences are also defined which relate to the failure to disclose any of the three primary acts and tipping off. Tipping off is where someone informs a person or persons involved in, or suspected to be involved in money laundering acts, in such a way as to reduce the likelihood of their being investigated.

  

2.  While the risk to the company of breaching legislation is considered to be low, employees in all areas should be aware that they could be potentially exposed to money laundering acts. It is important that all employees’ are aware of their responsibility to report any suspicions of money laundering activity as detailed within this policy (see reporting). All employees are responsible to act promptly and report any suspicions to the General Manager to prevent any breach of legislation which can lead to serious criminal penalties.
    

  

  

**Reporting**
    

  

1.  Any employee who suspects money laundering activity should report their suspicions promptly to the General Manager.
    

  

2.  No further enquiries should be made about the suspected money laundering after reporting to the General Manager for action. No further steps in any transaction relating to the suspected money laundering should be made without authorisation from the General Manager.
    

  

3.  No disclosure should be made to others that would indicate suspicions of money laundering. Any employee reporting should not discuss the matter with others or note on file that a report has been made General Manager as this may result in the suspect becoming aware of the situation.
    

  

4.  The General Manager will promptly evaluate any Disclosure Report to determine whether it should be reported to the authorities.
    

  

5.  The General Manager will, if necessary, promptly report the matter to the relevant authorities.
    

  

6.  Failure to report a disclosure is considered a criminal offence without reasonable grounds. All disclosures will be retained on file for five years.
    

  

**Customer Due Diligence**
    

  

1.  Extra care needs to be taken when the company is carrying out regulated activities, this is known as customer due diligence. Due to the nature and stringent guidelines for regulated business, you will be aware if your duties involve regulated activities.
    

  

2.  If customer due diligence (CDD) applies, you must seek evidence of identity, for example:
    

  

*   Check the business’s website to confirm their business address.
    
*   Conduct an on-line search to confirm the nature of business and identity of any directors.
    
*   Seek evidence from the key contact of their personal identity following the guidelines for identifying customers.
    
*   Identification must be retained for five years after the end of the business relationship.
    

  

**Guidance and Training**
    

  

1.  The company will make all employees aware of the requirements and obligations placed on the company and on themselves as individuals by anti-money laundering legislation and give targeted training to those most likely to encounter money laundering.
    

  

**Appendix**

  

All employees should be vigilant to suspicious activity, in particular when handling cash and other monetary transactions and when procuring works.

  

The following examples for situations which may give rise to money laundering or the suspicion of it:

  

*   Those involved in the handling of criminal property look for ways to
    

secure and safeguard the proceeds of their criminal activities.

*   Although other ways exist, cash is the mainstay of criminal
    

transactions, being the most reliable and flexible, and having little or

no audit trail.

*   Criminals often transport cash out using couriers, usually
    

through airports, to pay into banks abroad, to purchase property

abroad, or to pay to their families.

*   One of the most popular method of laundering money is thought
    

to be the purchase of property, followed by investment in front

companies (these are companies used as a front or ‘decoy’ for illegal activities) or high cash turnover businesses (frequently legitimate

businesses), or funding a lifestyle.

*   After property, the most significant assets bought by criminals are
    

jewellery, artwork, antiques, cars and boats.

*   The investment of cash in financial products with a view to selling
    

them quickly (if necessary at a loss) is used.

*   Criminals use trusts to launder money because of their secretive
    

nature and flexibility, often using front companies to hide identities.

*   Gambling large amounts of cash at relatively low odds is used, since
    

winnings are usually received in the form of cheque payments

*   Criminals use ‘layering ’ to confuse the audit trail – this involves
    

passing transactions through several stages, often eventually banking

the proceeds as business income, and transferring the money

overseas to a country whose regulatory regime is weaker.

  

Any transaction involving an unusually large amount of cash should cause

questions to be asked about the source. This will particularly be the case

where cash paid exceeds the amount necessary to settle a transaction, and

the person(s) concerned request a non-cash refund of the excess. This will

include double payments.

  

The reason for the use of trusts or offshore funds for handling the

proceeds or settlement of a transaction should be questioned.

  

Care should be exercised and further enquiries may be needed where:

*   a third party intermediary becomes involved in a transaction
    
*   the identity of a party is difficult to establish or is undisclosed
    
*   a company is used by a third party and the ultimate ownership
    

is concealed or difficult to establish

*   a party is evasive as to the source or destiny of funds.
    

  

It should be remembered that the money-laundering regime adopts an ‘all-crimes’ approach. Whilst the above examples are largely concerned with significant transactions which organisations may effect with third parties, the offences may apply to a very wide range of more everyday activities within an organisation.

For example, being complicit in crimes involving the falsification of claims, benefiting from non-compliance with the conditions attaching to a grant, or facilitating employment on which tax is not paid.

  

  

  

**How could money laundering occur within our Company?**

  

Money laundering may occur during day to day business activities within the company; these are issues all employees should be aware of:

  

*   Are business relationships documented for loans and investments?
    
*   Are customers identified and information retained for five years after the transaction?
    

*   Use local knowledge, this increased knowledge may increase suspicions, if in doubt, report it!
    
*   Think about the impact on the company if lack of awareness is identified and inappropriate relationships are formed.
    

  

**Business rates**

  

Consideration of the following examples of best practice:

  

*   Are business directors identified as bona fide?
    
*   Is the business legitimate and have we confirmed this?
    
*   Is information retained?
    

  

**Licensing**

  

*   Have we identified the customer requesting a licence?
    
*   Has the nature of the relationship been clearly defined and is the application viable and legitimate?
    

  

**Training**

  

*   Employees must be vigilant at all times.
    
*   If in doubt, report it.
    
*   The Money Laundering Policy should be adhered to and further guidance requested from the General Manager where needed.
    
*   Access further information via the sources in section eight of this document, for detailed guidance.
    

  

**Employees visiting businesses and properties**

  

*   If suspicious activity is suspected during a property visit, employees should report the matter via the money laundering reporting procedure.
    

  

**Identification**

  

*   Only original forms of valid identification and verification should be accepted in line with the cashiering procedure notes.
    
*   Identification should be retained for reference for five years after the relationship has ended, reference to the transaction to which the identification relates should also be clearly documented.
    

  

**Procurement**

  

*   Are tender documents clear and is it stipulated that employees performing contract works are legitimate?
    
*   Are new suppliers identified as bone fide?
    

  

**Debtors**

  

*   Cash overpayments are repeatedly received to a debtor account without reasonable explanation, and refunds are given in the form of a cheque, this may be a means to conceal the source of money obtained from illegal activities.
